## Basketball Fantasy Team Value Calculator

#### Purpose of this application:
This application will allow users to add up to 15 NBA players on a team and fill in their stats. The application will  
then compute the value of the player from a mathematical formula. This formula will be based on how significant the  
impact of each statistic is in winning the particular statistical category. The formula will calculate the value  
contributed by the following categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, three pointers made and turnovers.    
The less frequent each stat is recorded, the more value it holds when a player records it. This application would also    
provide users with their team's average value per player.

#### Users who play NBA fantasy pools with seven categories would use this application to: 

* Check what each player's value is in order to draft better players
* Check players values to compare players when making trades or waiver wire acquisitions
* Check how their fantasy team compares to other fantasy teams they are competing with

#### Personal interest:
This application interests me because I play NBA Fantasy every year in a categorical format, and I find myself always   
comparing my team to my opponents' teams and trying to find better players to fill out my roster. I thought that it  
would be very beneficial to be able to compare players values statistically to each other in a fantasy league. There  
is usually big money on the line and even one player can be the difference between winning big or losing badly in any   
given week. Creating an application that not only other players can use, but I personally can use too makes me very   
interested in making an application like this.
